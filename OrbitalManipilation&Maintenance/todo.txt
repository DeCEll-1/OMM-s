What I got so far:
-ships are done for the most part, except for the 2 algae ships. Improving sprites steadily over time
- systems (or their frameweork at least) are done except for algae ships, sand hopper and Sesarma (modular transport, probably fine with some maneuvering thrusters or active flares)
- half of the ships have desciptions. making those bit by bit
- framework for deployable platforms is done in form of Sand Hopper Def Platform script and the Octocorallia weapon platform, as well as algae pod and smlalgae script
~ (get weapon swap and aiming/shooting for drones to work consistantly) known issue: no command stransfer possible
- Done! So far only pd Drone and universal medium mount drone implemented, need more options. That one is easy to solve and I am working on it right now
- Done! some general balancing, mount/drone layout and proper variants. That's something I can handle
~ (subsystem on all ships with drones to better utilise them) temporary fix for AI/drone behaviour


Things that need doing:

- Sand Hopper needs system: combination of damper field and burn drive with fighter collision to "jump over" other ships
- Proper visuals for Nathantias system which provides temporal shell for allies. System works fine imo, just needs better indicater where its coming from and who is buffed
- faction hullmod that provides lesser effect of solar shielding, salvage gantry and drone OP cost reduction. 
         Also orbital colony parts build speed increase on campaign level would be nice

- Sesarma needs a container sprite and code that attaches/changes container depending on logistics hullmod. Sprite isn't the problem, just the code
- both algae ships are made to deploy the algae, providing a "buff aura" improving weapon/engine repair and fighter replacement with some green particles (algae & nanobots) flying around to mark area
- campaign integration in form of extra markets attached to normal markets (see Arma Armatura as an example) 
  on indipendent stations in Anthozoa Station, Nova Maxios, Eldfell and Ilm, Anthozoa being their company HQ orbiting a portal being salvaged.

- at some point weapons but that is not important for first release
- at some point "Flip" System for experimental ship but priority is very low for that
- Oh, and I wanted the 2 algae ships to provide supplies and fuel depending on CR. Consumes crew to do this. Doesn't need to be a huge amount of supplies/fuel, 
  just enough for the ship itself and maybe 2 destroyers. the capital sized one could provide a bit more but I'm trying to keep it reasonable to not be unbalanced
